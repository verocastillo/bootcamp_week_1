# bootcamp_week_1
Repository with my first week's activities and homework!

#excel_proficiency
This folder includes different files with the activities done during the
course of the week, where I demonstrate proficiency in Excel, as well as 
reflecting new knowledge acquired during my classes. 

#kickstarter_analysis
This folder includes an Excel analysis and report on the success rate
of Kickstarter projects. A database of 4000 projects was analyzed by using
tables, formulas, pivot tables and pivot charts.
The conclusions drawn from the report are included in a Word document.

#BONUS!
I updated this repository to include an aditional Excel file with the 
bonus exercises included. This required the use of conditionals and 
statistical analysis.
