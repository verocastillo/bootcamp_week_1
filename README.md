# bootcamp_week_1
Repository with my first week's activities and homework!

This repository includes an Excel analysis and report on the success rate
of Kickstarter projects. A database of 4000 projects was analyzed by using
tables, different formulas, pivot tables and pivot charts.

The conclusions drawn from the report are included in a Word document.
