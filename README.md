# bootcamp_week_1
Repository with my first week's homework!
As an advanced Excel user, it was great to have the opportunity to put all
of my skills to work during my first week at Data Bootcamp.

**kickstarter_analysis**

This folder includes an Excel analysis and report on the success rate
of Kickstarter projects. A database of 4000 projects was analyzed by using
tables, formulas, pivot tables and pivot charts.
The conclusions drawn from the report are included in a Word document.

**BONUS!**

I updated this repository to include an aditional Excel file with the 
bonus exercises included. These exercises required the use of conditionals
and statistical analysis.
